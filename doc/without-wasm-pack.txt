I had some requirements to use web-assembly.

1. load web-assembly separately from javascript at http page. 
2. have well transpiled type-script declaration.

I tried to run wasm-pack with web option first, I could not get either
requirements. If I load wasmpack separately, I had to write type-script
declaration by hand. If I use transpiled type-script declations, I had no
choice but to load one javascript embedding web-assebmly.

I customized [wasm-bindgen tool](https://github.com/toshiyuki-rs/wasm-bindgen)
to generate type-script declaration for my requirement.
The wasm-bindgen-cli has new option web-bundler. The option 
generates type-script declaration to use compiled web-assembly which is fetched
lately.

I would like to use the customized wasm-bindgen tool  with wasm-pack, but
wasm-pack did not give me the way to load the customized wasm-bindgen tool.
I gave up to use wasm-pack for my purpose.
